# Tableau-Log-Viewer

Tableau Log Viewer is used to analyze and view Tableau's JSON log files and supports highlighting and filtering of events. It is based on [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) and has been tested to work on Windows and Mac OS.

Tableau Log Viewer provides a human readable, hierarchical interface. It provides sorting, filtering, and highlighting capabilities which make it easy to look through logs to find relevant events. We have shown this tool in talks and consistently have heard customers ask, "Can I have this now?".
